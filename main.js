This is from a series of string challenges to help you get to grips with JS string methods. This challenge will also focus on INPUT VALIDATION!  


Hello again challenger! This time your task is to write a function named `removeVowels` which takes in a string and returns the string with all vowels removed. 
- If input is an empty string, it should return the message "There is nothing to remove!". 
- If the function is missing an input, then it should THROW an error message "There is no input to check!"
- It doesn't matter if the letters are lower or uppercase, ALL vowels need to be removed.


Examples(Input --> Output):

removeVowels() --> throws error "Input string is required!"
"" --> "There is nothing to remove!"
"AEIOU are vowels." --> " r vwls."
"John mcclane" --> "Jhn Mccln"
"I enjoy solving coding challenges daily." --> " njy slvng cdng chllngs dly."
"UsE PlAywRiGHt fOr Api TesTinG!" -->  "s PlywRGHt fr p TsTnG!"
